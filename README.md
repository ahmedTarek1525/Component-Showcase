This React app is designed to provide hands-on practice with various components and functional implementation. Here’s what we’re aiming to achieve:

Navigation Bar:
The app will feature a navigation bar on the left-hand side.
Users will find links to different pages they can navigate to.
Clicking on a link will take users to a specific page, revealing unique content.

Component Pages:
Each page will display a distinct component,These components will cover essential concepts like state management, event handling, and props.These are components that are commonly needed in various projects.

Styling Approach:
Instead of manually creating CSS files, the app explores a different styling approach.
This project will introduce alternative methods for applying styles to React components using TailwindCSS.

Application Size:
While this app will be larger than the previous projects, it won’t be overly complex. Since the components won’t need to share data extensively, it serves as an excellent stepping stone for larger projects in the future.
